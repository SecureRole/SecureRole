\section{OSINT}

The attackers gather OSINT about the company, for their attack to be more effective.
This will not be played out in the role-playing game, but we will include it in the additional information.

\begin{hint}[Important Information]
    You can discuss the OSINT topic with your participants, but this activity should be done \textbf{after} the game, so as not to spoil any information.
    We will provide additional materials regarding OSINT, so your students can study them on their own or in class.
\end{hint}
