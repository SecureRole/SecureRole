\subsection{OSINT}
We briefly mentioned that the attacker can gather information and material about the victim using OSINT. But what is OSINT? \\ 
Open-source intelligence (OSINT) is the intelligence that can be drawn from publicly accessible information. This information can be accessed without needing any special skills and the information can be gathered from the internet, social media, journals. \\
For example, viewing someone's public profile on social media and extracting information is considered as OSINT. So, the attackers gather information from the victim's social media profiles and with the help of this information, they try to build phishing emails in such way that it looks more credible to the victim..
