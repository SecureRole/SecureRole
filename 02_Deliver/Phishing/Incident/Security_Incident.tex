\section*{Security Incident}
As you already know, this role play is about a security incident. Congratulations, you have received the roles where it starts.
Friday is always one of those days when you want to get off work as quickly as possible and still have a lot of things to do, so it's a time where you are prone to mistakes. You 
have received many emails and a client has sent you his documents via a Dropbox link.

You open the link to download the file, but the page takes a long time to load, but you are finally able to download the document.
You cannot assign the contents of the invoice to a customer and decide to check back with your customer.
He informs you that he did not yet send you an e-mail, so you decide to try to recover the one you just received, but you already deleted it.
Nevertheless you inform IT about the occurrence.
