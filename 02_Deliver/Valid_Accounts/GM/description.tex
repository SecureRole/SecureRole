\subsubsection{Valid Accounts}

The attacker has gathered a list of valid accounts from an AOL breach.
The database dump contains besides personal details also passwords in cleartext.

The attacker tried to use the credentials on different VPN Gateways to get access.
He was successful with accounts from the company in this game.

After he has access to the internal network of the company, he makes a network scan with NMAP and finds a computer that he can access with the credentials via RDP.
This allows him to use his tools on that computer without being detected.

The following security measures have failed.
\begin{itemize}
    \item No password policies are implemented in the system
    \item No multi-factor authentication is implemented in the system
    \item There is no limitation on the amount of time a user can try to log in.
    \item Detection of unusual login outside of the office hours.
\end{itemize}
