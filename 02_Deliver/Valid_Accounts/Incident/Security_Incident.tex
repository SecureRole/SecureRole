\section*{Security Incident}
As you already know, this roleplay is about a security incident. Congratulations, you have received the roles where it starts.
Friday is always one of those days when you want to get off work as quickly as possible and still have a lot of things to do, so it's a time where you are prone to mistakes. 
The only thing you want is to go home and get some rest.
It's 4 o'clock and you powered off your monitors and you are about to go home.

After you enjoyed the weekend it's time to get back to work.
You turned on the monitors and you are logged in.

You noticed that a blue window with white text is open, you are not entirely sure, but it looks like a PowerShell terminal.
