\chapter{Introduction}
This document will give you an idea about what we mean when we talk about an attack using valid accounts and the possible mitigations for it.

Valid Accounts or compromised accounts are used by adversaries to gain access to a protected network or system by using credentials they obtained from a source.

In \autoref{chapter:validaccounts_sources} you will get an overview of several sources you can find credentials.
Keep in mind that this list only covers a portion of ways to gather this information and an attack usually consists of a combination of different attack techniques combined.

\chapter{Types}
The MITRE Att\&ck Framework refers Valid Accounts in the Technique category of Initial Access and findable with technique ID \href{https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/}{T1078}.
The framework distinguishes four sub-techniques, that the adversary can use to get access.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Default Accounts
    \item Domain Accounts
    \item Local Accounts
    \item Cloud Accounts
\end{itemize}

\section{Default Accounts}
The installation of new software or device in a system usually requires signing, by using preinstalled credentials to configure.
If these credentials aren't changed afterwards, a loophole opens in the system through which access can be gained when it's exposed to the Internet.
This is relatively easy to be misused, they only have to know the default credentials.

\section{Domain Accounts}
Companies have in most cases a centralized identity and access management system, short for IAM, that manages the credentials.
By connecting devices and software to an IAM system, it's possible to manage the access control of it in the IAM system and log in with the same credentials.

The following \autoref{fig:aad} is an Azure Active Directory, short AAD, service managed in the Azure Cloud.
You see, that different system is connected to AAD and manages different aspects of authentication and authorization.

\begin{figure}[h]

    \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{./images/aad.png}
    \caption{Azure Active Directory}
    \label{fig:aad}
\end{figure}

\section{Local Accounts}
These types of credentials are used to log in to a system with credentials that are only available on it.
In comparison to Domain Accounts, it isn't possible to log in to other systems with those credentials.

\section{Cloud Accounts}
By setting up a cloud infrastructure you also have to create credentials, that allow access to different guides of resources.
The created credentials are associated with permissions to access, for example, databases or cloud storage resources.
Depending on what is additionally connected to the cloud IAM system it could allow an adversary access to the on-premise system.

\chapter{Sources}
\label{chapter:validaccounts_sources}
From an attacker's perspective, you first need to obtain the credentials.
It exists different methods to get it and we like to show you a few of them.

\section{Default Credentials - CIRT.net}
The website CIRT.net has a list of collected default accounts for various vendors.
On the website \href{https://cirt.net/passwords}{CIRT.net} is a comprehensive list of different vendors.

\section{Default Credentials - SSH Keys on Github}
Another place is to search on GitHub for credentials, this is because people forget to not include credentials in the git commit.
By including these credentials in a commit history, an attacker can easily search using the GitHub search feature.

To give you an impression of how to use GitHub to search for credentials, we do a short tutorial by searching for SSH Keys.

Many developers use an SSH Key to access different services such as Linux Servers or even GitHub repositories.
The following code snippet shows an SSH key generated with the OpenSSH Library.
The generation process of an asymmetric key pair outputs a private key and a public key.
As you suggest, the private key has to be kept private and the public key has to be shared with the parties (GitHub).
We also need the private key to get access to services that are associated with it.

\begin{lstlisting}
-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
b3BlbnNzaC1rZXktdjEAAAAABG5vbmUAAAAEbm9uZQAAAAAAAAABAAABlwAAAAdzc2gtcn
NhAAAAAwEAAQAAAYEAr7pINQ2m44vE3d4Ajmwu355yiK9ewuYCimpLFtrknu/pxM+rtr0r
...
kO1mHNWg5z4QH4Abgl2uSGaBgXjSOogo0ZWrtq4yVV4tDkDCUv4MRwYYkm3gDz6Znp2obo
BtAQqnizl+1GkAAAAQaXNhYWNAQ1JZUFRPTEFORAECAw==
-----END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
\end{lstlisting}

The private key usually begins with \enquote{-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----} or \enquote{-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----}, depending on the library used.
With a simple search on GitHub, you find real SSH Keys in commits, comments, or repositories.

There is for example a commit with the comment "Delete -----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----", but the Private Key is still present in the commit.
Can you spot it?


Its possible to automate the process on finding such keys, take a look at this \href{https://book.hacktricks.xyz/generic-methodologies-and-resources/external-recon-methodology/github-leaked-secrets}{site}.

\section{Mimikatz}
Mimikatz is one of the most commonly used tools to obtain credentials from an infected Windows system.
One critical part of the windows system is the \lstinline{lsass.exe} process that has to do authentication and therefore needs credentials for its job.
Here comes Mimikatz into it and dumps the memory of this process and carves out the credentials from it.

As you can see in the screenshot, 

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{./images/mimikatz.png}
    \caption{mimikatz}
    \label{fig:mimikatz}
\end{figure}

The tool is available on \href{https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz}{GitHub}. 

\section{Shoulder surfing}
Shoulder surfing is not only about looking over the shoulder of the target.
It can be performed from the close range or the long range.
The usage of field glasses can be used to capture the credentials from a wide range, without being noticed.
A hidden camera can also be used to capture it, cameras are nowadays little devices that are easy to install.

Creditcard thefts use hidden cameras to get details, by installing additional hardware on the ATMs.
The \autoref{fig:atm} shows a little camera installed on the card slot.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{./images/atmcamera.png}
    \caption{ATM Camera}
    \label{fig:atm}
\end{figure}

\section{Brute Force}
Trying out password combinations is easy to perform, but in reality it usually takes a long time to get it right.
The process can be made more efficient by automating it.
For example, an attacker uses a brute-force tool to make many requests to a website, that isn't probably secured to prevent such attacks, or a list with password hashes is brute-forced with Hashcat.

\section{Credentials Stuffing}
According to a study from \href{https://services.google.com/fh/files/blogs/google_security_infographic.pdf}{Google}, 53\% are using the same password for multiple accounts on different services.
In the context of cybersecurity, it means that it is possible to use a breached password and test it against other services.

An attacker is collecting data from different sources to create a list of credentials, containing usernames and passwords.
The attacker then uses the created database to get access to other services, because the human being tends to reuse passwords.
If he has success in trying it, it's possible to misuse it.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{./images/credential-stuffing.png}
    \caption{Credentials Stuffing}
    \label{fig:credentialstuffing}
\end{figure}

\chapter{Mitigations}
Different mitigations can protect against valid accounts being misused.
The MITRE Att\&ck Framework has different techniques and techniques for mitigations against it.
For the valid accounts, they list these five mitigations for it.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Password Policies 
    \item Multi-factor Authentication 
    \item Privileged Account Management 
    \item User Training 
    \item User Account Management 
\end{itemize}

This list includes some, handy mitigations but there are also additional ones that can help to protect against it.
We added some.

\section{Password Policies}
Making sure a password follows a set of rules, can reduce the risk of password reused and its complexity of it.
Besides applying those password policies you also have to make sure, to enforce them on the different systems.

An active directory can set some rules for password policies, as you see in the \autoref{fig:adpasswordpolicy}

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{./images/passwordpolicy.png}
    \caption{Password Policy}
    \label{fig:adpasswordpolicy}
\end{figure}

\section{Multi-factor Authentication} 


\section{Privileged Account Management} 
Employees of the IT department usually use two accounts for their work, depending on the task they are using a regular account or a privileged one.
These privileged accounts may also be a service account that has special access or privileged access to systems.

The part of auditing and making sure the privileged accounts are used correctly used and not abused.
Monitoring and controlling accounts have to be done regularly.
This ensures that trusted individuals do not abuse their privileges and that privileges are revoked when they are no longer needed.

\textit{What are its advantages of it?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Grant privileges to users only for the systems they are authorized to access.
    \item Grant access only when it's needed and revoke access as soon as the need expires.
    \item Eliminate local/direct system passwords for privileged users.
    \item Centrally manage access over a disparate set of heterogeneous systems.
    \item Create an unalterable audit trail for any privileged operation.
\end{itemize}

\section{User Training}
Technically, a system can be made secure, but it's so secure as it is used by the users.
Ensuring the implements are used appropriately, making sure the users are aware of their actions, and taking security seriously.

Training end-users is a hard task, but it can be done with appropriately designed training material.
Training should consist of the following topics.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Phishing and social engineering
    \item Access, passwords, and connection
    \item Device security
    \item Physical security
\end{itemize}

\section{User Account Management}
We start with an example.
Employees start on a given day and their employment ends on a given day.
The IT department has therefore to create accounts, set the right permissions, and make sure it is correctly used by the new user.
Probably the employee needs more permission because the field he works in is changing.
At the end of employment, an account is disabled or completely remove from the system.

The example above, shows that users are usually gaining more permissions to the system and if we take the example to a hundred or thousand users the IT department has to make sure the "added" permissions are still in use.
Therefore, it is recommended to regularly check the accounts to make sure that they are not still in use or inactive.

You also have to make sure, that users can't create additional accounts and can not modify permissions of systems.
The IT department has to have control over it


\section{CAPTCHA}
The abbreviation stands for \endquote{Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Aparts}.
As the acronym suggests, it is intended to tell a computer whether a visitor is a bot or a human.
This should help to control bot activity and from a security perspective for example defend against DDoS Attacks or even Brute-Force attempts.
The user has to identify numbers and letters, which are displayed on a website as shown in \autoref{fig:captcha}.
Over time, machines have learned to interpret these images and are now able to identify the characters as well.
That is why reCAPTCHA was introduced by Google.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.75\textwidth]{./images/captcha.png}
    \caption{Captcha}
    \label{fig:captcha}
\end{figure}

The new reCAPTCHA has a different method to identify bots.
For example, a new approach is to make a traditional CAPTCHA test with recognition for characters, but with the difference, the pictures are gathered from real texts.

Other methods are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Checkboxes
    \item General user behaviour
    \item Image recognition
\end{itemize}
