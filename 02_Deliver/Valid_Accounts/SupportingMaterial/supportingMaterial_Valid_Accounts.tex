\chapter{Additional material}
\section{Valid Account}
The two most important documents created for this game are the game master document, which contains all the essential details for the game master on how to moderate the game, and the character sheets, which are given to each player participating in the game with a description of each role.

If you are not that familiar with valid accounts or want to refresh your memory and repeat some things you learned a long time ago, our team has created a document explaining it as a threat and its mitigations. 
However, if you are interested more in this topic and need more material, we have listed materials below that might be helpful for you.
