\section{Man-in-the-middle attack}

The attackers launches different attacks to George's computer, one after another.
\\

The attacker has inserted himself between George's computer and the gateway. He is eavesdropping the connection.
He then tricks the gateway by telling that he is George's machine and tricks George's computer by telling it that he is the gateway. 
\\
IP forwarding is then turned on, so this way, packets that are not meant for the attacker can actually be received by him.

After he inserted himself in the connection, following events are happening

\begin{itemize}
    \item Driftnet is used, so all images sent in George's traffic are stolen.
    \item Attacker creates a fake website that looks very similar to the company's website, using Kali Social Engineering Toolkit
    \item In the fake website, malicious code gets executed which gives the attacker full control over George's computer
\end{itemize}


\begin{hint}[Important Information]
    You can discuss the different steps of the attack with your participants, but this activity should be done \textbf{after} the game, so as not to spoil any information.
    You can discuss about ARP poisoning, DNS cache poisoning and their risks. 
    We strongly recommend reading additional material before the game, as they will be helpful to
