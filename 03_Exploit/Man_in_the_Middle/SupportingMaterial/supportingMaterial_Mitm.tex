\section{Man-in-the-middle attack} 
The two most important documents created for this game are the game master document, which contains all the essential details for the game master on how to moderate the game, and the character sheets, which are given to each player participating in the game with a description of each role. \\

If you are not that familiar with different Man-in-the-Middle attack techniques or want to refresh your memory and repeat some concepts you learned a long time ago, our team has created a script explaining them. 
However, if you are interested in this topic and need more material, we have listed materials below that might be helpful for you.
