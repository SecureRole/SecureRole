\section{Containment and restoration}

Now it is up to the students to contain the spread of the ransomware and to restore the system back to normal operations.
While we have provided some cards, which can help you guide them along, we feel that this part of the role play needs a little guidance as possible.
The only restrictions that apply are the needs of the CEO, the functionality of the backups, and the interactions with the hackers.
\\


\begin{hint}[Important Information]    For an optimal learning experience of your students, intervene as little as possible during this step.
    Only take up actions when they strongly deviate from the storyboard or head in an impossible direction.
    \\

    Should they choose to interact with the hackers it is up to you to play this part.
    See \autoref{sec:paying_the_ransom}
\end{hint}

\section{Paying the ransom}
\label{sec:paying_the_ransom}

In case your players want to go down the ransom path, it is up to you to play the hackers.
Your main goal is to negotiate a high price for the data you encrypted.
We suggest a starting bid of USD 200'000\$.
The CEO of the company, Stefania (which could be you, depending on the number of players), is very reluctant to pay more than USD 100'000\$, as this would cause significant damage to the company.
\\

It is up to you to haggle and negotiate with the players until you have reached a satisfying conclusion.
You can also decide whether to take the money and not hand over the decryption keys (so that they have to use the backups, which will extend the game's runtime) or hand them the keys and end the game with them decrypting the data using the WannaCry decryption tool.

\section{Conclusion}

Once the game is over (you can decide when that is the case, depending on the time spent and the progress made) you can stop the game.
We strongly recommend that you plan 15-30 minutes for an in-depth discussion of how the game went and what students learned from it.
Be sure to have this discussion immediately after the game so that the memory is still fresh.
