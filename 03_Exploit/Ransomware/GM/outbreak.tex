\section{Ransomware outbreak}

Now your students (mainly the ones playing the IT department) are faced with a ransomware outbreak.
It's WannaCry, and many workstations are infected.
The only workstations that are not infected are those in the department IT, because they have the latest patches installed and are therefore immune to the spread of WannaCry.
\\

The job of the students now is to find a way to recover to normal operation, with as little downtime as possible.
Please make sure the accounting participants voice their concerns about the attack and put pressure on the department since they cannot work.
This makes the role-play more dynamic.
