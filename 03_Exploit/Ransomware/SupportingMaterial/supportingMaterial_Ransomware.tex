\chapter{Introduction}

This file is in a similar structure as the script.
It aims to give you more information about specific topics along the way.
\\

While we do feature some supporting literature, we encourage you to look into the bibliography of the script since it contains all the referenced literature.
You can then directly search for the corresponding articles or, in some cases, even directly follow the link to the source material.
\\

Everybody learns things in different ways.
We made sure to include various media to accommodate all learner types.
So we got articles, videos, podcasts, reports, images, charts, etc\dots.
\\

Since all of the media is linked and not included, we did \textbf{not} include a bibliography.
