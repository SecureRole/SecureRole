\chapter{Game setup}
\label{sec:game_setup}

So now that you have familiarized yourself with the content of the game you can start to plan it.
\\

You will roughly need to plan 60-90 minutes for this game.
Even though this varies from game to game, depending on the level of interaction you can achieve between your students.
\\

The roles will be distributed as following:

\section{3 players or less}

If you are less than 3 people, the game might be shorter than 60 minutes.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Christian: Will take over all responsibilities in the IT department
    \item George: Will take over all responsibilities in the accounting department
    \item Sergio and share the tasks between Christian and Sergio
    \item If you are only 2-3 players, the GM should take over the role of Stefania.
        It is the role with the least impact on the outcome of the game.
\end{itemize}

\section{4 players}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Add Stefania and assign her duties to one of the participants instead of you.
\end{itemize}

\section{5 players}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Add Max and share the tasks between Max and Sergio
\end{itemize}

\section{6 players or more}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Add Susie and share the tasks between George and Susie
    \item You can add more players, by increasing the number of IT staff, it is not suggested to increase the number of accountants, since it has no impact on the game itself.
\end{itemize}
