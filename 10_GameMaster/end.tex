\begin{hint}[Important Information]
    \textbf{Keep track of the time!}
    \\

    We advise you to keep track of the time, since your students will need to come to a satisfying conclusion \textbf{and you need to have time to discuss the game afterwards.} It is important that you plane enough time for the retrospective in the end, since it is the most important part in the learning journey.
