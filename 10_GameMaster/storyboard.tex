\chapter{The Storyboard}
\label{sec:storyboard_main}

\section{Overview}

The overview contains all important information about the whole scenario in a compressed form.

\begin{hint}[Important Information]
    It is ideal to have the overview at hand during the role play so that you do not have to read the whole document again.
\end{hint}
\section{Storyboard}
\label{sec:storyboard}

The storyboard contains every major event during this game as a "card".
The cards are structured in a way to make life easier for you.
You can see a card explained in \autoref{img:card_explanation}.
\\

\begin{hint}[Important Information]
    The cards help you gain an instant visual overview of the whole board.
    A description of how the cards are structured can be found in \autoref{img:card_explanation}.
    We know that it is impossible to account for every decision that your players will make (we played role-playing games before).
    So please only use this storyboard as a rough guideline of how a game \textbf{could} unfold.
    Don't try to force the players down this path. 
    Instead, use your imagination and this document to achieve a good result.
\end{hint}
