Hello there!

We are the Team behind SecureRole, the comprehensive library of class materials, regarding role playing scenarios for cyber security courses. 

We strive to provide you with a varied selection of different scenarios, which you can use to teach about the risks of cyber security threats, and how to mitigate them.
For the purpose of this pursuit, we have created a variety of different courses, which you can access free of charge, and use as you please.

## Who are we?

We are Anina Bytyçi, Isaac Würth and Marco Zanetti.
Three bachelor students at OST - Ostschweizer Fachhochschule, currently writing our bachelor thesis. We are all studing information technology, with a special focus on cyber security.

## Why are we doing this?

While the initial idea behind this thesis, was to provide course materials for our own college. 
We thought it would be a waste, not to share our gathered knowledge with the world, and make it publicly accessible. 
So here we are!

Our main goal is to provide role-playing games that will educate participating students about different types of current cyber attacks.
We will try to choose and create scenarios that have already happened or are similar to known attacks.
This can range from smaller personal incidents, such as a phishing attack, or a social engineering attempt, up to large scale attacks, such as the notpetya malware incident.

We want to teach them how to..:
- ...identify such attacks. 
- ...how to behave when being attacked.
- ...how to mitigate the effects of an ongoing attack.
- ...how to prevent attacks.
- ...how to reduce your personal attack surface.
- ...and many more things.

These role playing games come in the form of written "character sheets", like the ones you may be familiar with from classic table top role-playing games (hence nor name Secure Rule)
They provide each player with an insight into their role and supply all the necessary information about their character's behaviour and knowledge.
Now it is up to the students, and one or two teachers/professors/trainers to enact the role playing games, and try to educate their students in a playful and immersive way.

To increase the educational effect, we enrich our role playing games with additional information material.
This can include, but is not limited to:
- Text scripts with explanations
- Course slides
- CVE's
- Third party content, such as videos and news articles
- And many more!

Most of our work will be based on existing work, such as official guidelines, playbooks, and best practices.
We will share a comprehensive list with you, should we use such works, so you can make sure, that the provided materials are up to date and in line with current standards.
